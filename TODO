The plan was to gut RT-Integration-SVN and make it a 4.0 compat extension which
supports git/svn and whatever else you want via simple webhooks.  This repo is
no more than RT-Integration-SVN converted to git and the beginnings of gutting
it.  My rough notes for this extension are below:

webhook endpoint: https://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/hook/commit/<queue>/<token>

    <queue> is informational and tied to <token>
    <token> is a shared secret so that only allowed parties can ping the hook
    <token> is managed by an RT web admin interface, probably on a per-queue basis

Uses Github's JSON webhook payload: https://help.github.com/articles/post-receive-hooks

Only require Most basic structure so non-github hooks can easily generate it:
    {
        commits => [
            {
                id      => "opaque string",
                message => "text",
                url     => "http or https url to link to",
                author  => "string or...",
                author  => {
                    name  => "string",
                }
            }
        ],
    }

Include example post-receive/commit hooks for git and svn

Scans message for:

    RT-Ticket: \d+
    RT-Status: \w+


Heuristic mode for:

    [rt.cpan.org #\d+]
    rt.cpan.org #\d+
    bug #?\d+
    ticket #?\d+

Auto-close mode:

    (Resolves|Closes) prefixed on any ticket reference?

Records note on ticket like so:

    <Author> mentioned this bug in commit <id> ... blah blah blah

where <id> is linked if possible.

Set "Fixed in" somehow when a tag is pushed?
